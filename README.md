# Chemical-Data-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing molecular properties of selected drug-like compounds, including Aspirin and Paracetamol. The dataset used in this project contains key molecular properties such as Molecular Weight, LogP, InChIKey, and Canonical SMILES. Molecular weight affects solubility, with larger molecules requiring solvents that can dissolve them effectively. LogP, which indicates a compound's hydrophobicity, helps determine whether a drug is more compatible with water-based or lipid-based solvents.
